Hello everyone!

My name is Anton Trushkevich, I'm a Ruby / Ruby on Rails developer from Minsk, Belarus and I’m starting a blog at last. I’m going to post here different programming-related stuff, code snippets, useful links and so on. Posts can be pretty large as well as just one-liners. Comments to all posts are very appreciated - both positive and negative. I hope this blog will be helpful for someone.

Ok, let’s go.
